    "speaker" : "CHRIS WALLACE",
    "statement" : "Good evening from the Health Education Campus of Case Western Reserve University and the Cleveland Clinic. I'm Chris Wallace of Fox News and I welcome you to the first of the 2020 Presidential Debates between President Donald J. Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden. This debate is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential debates. The Commission has designed the format, six roughly 15 minute segments with two minute answers from each candidate to the first question, then open discussion for the rest of each segment. Both campaigns have agreed to these rules. For the record, I decided the topics and the questions in each topic. I can assure you none of the questions has been shared with the Commission or the two candidates."
  }, {
    "speaker" : "CHRIS WALLACE",
    "statement" : "This debate is being conducted under health and safety protocols designed by the Cleveland Clinic, which is serving as the Health Security advisor to the Commission for all four debates. As a precaution, both campaigns have agreed the candidates will not shake hands at the beginning of tonight's debate. The audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent. No cheers, no boos, or other interruptions so we, and more importantly you, can focus on what the candidates have to say. No noise except right now, as we welcome the Republican nominee, President Trump, and the Democratic nominee Vice President Biden."
  }, {
    "speaker" : "JOE BIDEN",
    "statement" : "How you doing, man?"
  }, {
    "speaker" : "DONALD TRUMP",
    "statement" : "How are you doing?"
  }, {
    "speaker" : "JOE BIDEN",
    "statement" : "I'm well."
  }, {
    "speaker" : "CHRIS WALLACE",
    "statement" : "Gentlemen, a lot of people been waiting for this night, so let's get going. Our first subject is the Supreme Court. President Trump, you nominated Amy Coney Barrett over the weekend to succeed the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the Court. You say the Constitution is clear about your obligation and the Senate's to consider a nominee to the Court. Vice President Biden, you say that this is an effort by the President and Republicans to jam through on an appointment in what you call an abuse of power. My first question to both of you tonight, why are you right in the argument you make and your opponent wrong? And where do you think a Justice Barrett would take the court? President Trump, in this first segment, you go first. Two minutes."
  }, {
    "speaker" : "DONALD TRUMP",
    "statement" : "Thank you very much, Chris. I will tell you very simply. We won the election. Elections have consequences. We have the Senate, we have the White House, and we have a phenomenal nominee respected by all. Top, top academic, good in every way. Good in every way. In fact, some of her biggest endorsers are very liberal people from Notre Dame and other places. So I think she's going to be fantastic. We have plenty of time. Even if we did it after the election itself. I have a lot of time after the election, as you know. So I think that she will be outstanding. She's going to be as good as anybody that has served on that court. We really feel that. We have a professor at Notre Dame, highly respected by all, said she's the single greatest student he's ever had. He's been a professor for a long time at a great school."
  }, {
    "speaker" : "DONALD TRUMP",
    "statement" : "And we won the election and therefore we have the right to choose her, and very few people knowingly would say otherwise. And by the way, the Democrats, they wouldn't even think about not doing it. The only difference is they'd try and do it faster. There's no way they would give it up. They had Merrick Garland, but the problem is they didn't have the election so they were stopped. And probably that would happen in reverse, also. Definitely would happen in reverse. So we won the election and we have the right to do it, Chris."
  }, {
    "speaker" : "CHRIS WALLACE",
    "statement" : "President Trump, thank you. Same question to you, Vice President Biden. You have two minutes."
  }, {
    "speaker" : "JOE BIDEN",
    "statement" : "Well, first of all, thank you for doing this and looking forward to this, Mr. President."
  }, {
    "speaker" : "DONALD TRUMP",
    "statement" : "Thank you, Joe."
  }, {
    "speaker" : "JOE BIDEN",
    "statement" : "The American people have a right to have a say in who the Supreme Court nominee is and that say occurs when they vote for United States Senators and when they vote for the President of United States. They're not going to get that chance now because we're in the middle of an election already. The election has already started. Tens of thousands of people already voted and so the thing that should happen is we should wait. We should wait and see what the outcome of this election is because that's the only way the American people get to express their view is by who they elect as President and who they elect as Vice President."
  }, {
    "speaker" : "JOE BIDEN",
    "statement" : "Now, what's at stake here is the President's made it clear, he wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. He's been running on that, he ran on that and he's been governing on that. He's in the Supreme Court right now trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, which will strip 20 million people from having health insurance now, if it goes into court. And the justice, I'm not opposed to the justice, she seems like a very fine person. But she's written, before she went in the bench, which is her right, that she thinks that the Affordable Care Act is not Constitutional. The other thing that's on the court, and if it's struck down, what happens? Women's rights are fundamentally changed. Once again, a woman could pay more money because she has a pre-existing condition of pregnancy. They're able to charge women more for the same exact procedure a man gets."
  }, {
    "speaker" : "JOE BIDEN",
    "statement" : "And that ended when we, in fact, passed the Affordable Care Act, and there's a hundred million people who have pre-existing conditions and they'll be taken away as well. Those pre-existing conditions, insurance companies are going to love this. And so it's just not appropriate to do this before this election. If he wins the election and the Senate is Republican, then he goes forward. If not, we should wait until February."
  }, {
    "speaker" : "DONALD TRUMP",
    "statement" : "There aren't a hundred million people with pre-existing conditions. As far as a say is concerned, the people already had their say. Okay, Justice Ginsburg said very powerfully, very strongly, at some point 10 years ago or so, she said a President and the Senate is elected for a period of time, but a President is elected for four years. We're not elected for three years. I'm not elected for three years. So we have the Senate, we have a President-"
  }, {
    "speaker" : "JOE BIDEN",
    "statement" : "He's elected to the next election."
  }, {
    "speaker" : "DONALD TRUMP",
    "statement" : "During that period of time, during that period of time, we have an opening. I'm not elected for three years. I'm elected for four years. Joe, the hundred million people is totally wrong. I don't know where you got that number. The bigger problem that you have is that you're going to extinguish 180 million people with their private health care, that they're very happy this."
  }, {
    "speaker" : "JOE BIDEN",
    "statement" : "That's simply not true."

    "speaker" : "CHRIS WALLACE",
    "statement" : "Open discussion, yes, I agree. Go ahead, Vice President."
  }, {
    "speaker" : "JOE BIDEN",
    "statement" : "Number one, he knows what I proposed. What I proposed is that we expand Obamacare and we increase it. We do not wipe any. And one of the big debates we had with 23 of my colleagues trying to win the nomination that I won, were saying that Biden wanted to allow people to have private insurance still. They can. They do. They will under my proposal."
  }, {
    "speaker" : "DONALD TRUMP",
    "statement" : "That's not what you've said and it's not what your party is saying."
  }, {
    "speaker" : "JOE BIDEN",
    "statement" : "That is simply a lie."
  }, {
    "speaker" : "DONALD TRUMP",

  }, {
    "speaker" : "DONALD TRUMP",
    "statement" : "Not according to Harris."
  }, {
    "speaker" : "JOE BIDEN",
    "statement" : "The platform of the Democratic Party is what I, in fact, approved of, what I approved of. Now, here's the deal. The deal is that it's going to wipe out pre-existing conditions. And, by the way, the 20, the 200 mil- the 200,000 people that have died on his watch, how many of those have survived? Well, there's seven million people that contracted COVID. What does it mean for them going forward if you strike down the Affordable Care Act?"
  }, {
    "speaker" : "DONALD TRUMP",
    "statement" : "Joe, you've had 308,000 military people dying because you couldn't provide them proper healthcare in the military. So don't tell me about this."
  }, {
    "speaker" : "JOE BIDEN",
    "statement" : "I'm happy to talk about this."
  }, {
    "speaker" : "DONALD TRUMP",
    "statement" : "And if you were here, it wouldn't be 200, it would be two million people because you were very late on the draw. You didn't want me to ban China, which was heavily infected. You didn't want me to ban Europe."
  }, {
    "speaker" : "CHRIS WALLACE",
    "statement" : "All right, gentlemen, Mr. President."

    "speaker" : "DONALD TRUMP",

  }, {
    "speaker" : "JOE BIDEN",
    "statement" : "Let me finish. The point is that the President also is opposed to Roe V. Wade. That's on the ballot as well and the court, in the court, and so that's also at stake right now. And so the election is all-"
  }, {
    "speaker" : "DONALD TRUMP",
    "statement" : "You don't know what's on the ballot. Why is it on the ballot? Why is it on the ballot? It's not on the ballot."

    "speaker" : "JOE BIDEN",
    "statement" : "It's on the ballot in the court."

  }, {
    "speaker" : "JOE BIDEN",
    "statement" : "All right."
  }, {
    "speaker" : "CHRIS WALLACE",
    "statement" : "Mr. President, the Supreme Court will hear a case a week after the election in which the Trump Administration, along with 18 state Attorney Generals are seeking to overturn Obamacare, to end Obamacare."

    "speaker" : "CHRIS WALLACE",

    "speaker" : "DONALD TRUMP",
    "statement" : "Yes, I have. Of course, I have. The individual mandate."

  }, {
    "speaker" : "DONALD TRUMP",
    "statement" : "That is absolutely a big thing. That was the worst part of Obamacare."

    "speaker" : "CHRIS WALLACE",
    "statement" : "I didn't ask, sir."
  }, {
    "speaker" : "DONALD TRUMP",

    "speaker" : "DONALD TRUMP",

    "statement" : "Go ahead."
  }, {
    "speaker" : "CHRIS WALLACE",
    "statement" : "You, in the course of these four years, have never come up with a comprehensive plan to replace Obamacare, and just this last Thursday you signed a largely symbolic Executive Order to protect people with pre-existing conditions five days before this debate. So my question, sir, is what is the Trump healthcare plan?"
  }, {
    "speaker" : "DONALD TRUMP",
    "statement" : "Well, first of all, I guess I'm debating you, not him, but that's okay. I'm not surprised. Let me just tell you something. There's nothing symbolic. I'm cutting drug prices. I'm going with Favored Nations, which no President has the courage to do because you're going against big pharma. Drug prices will be coming down 80 or 90%. You could have done it during your 47 year period in government, but you didn't do it. Nobody's done it. So we're cutting healthcare."
  }, {
    "speaker" : "CHRIS WALLACE",
    "statement" : "What about pre-existing conditions?"
  }, {
    "speaker" : "DONALD TRUMP",
    "statement" : "All of the things that we've done."
  }, {
    "speaker" : "JOE BIDEN",
    "statement" : "He has not done healthcare."
  }, {
    "speaker" : "DONALD TRUMP",
    "statement" : "I'll give you an example. Insulin, it was destroying families, destroying people, the cost. I'm getting it for so cheap it's like water, you want to know the truth. So cheap. Take a look at all of the drugs that what we're doing. Prescription drug prices, we're going to allow our Governors now to go to other countries to buy drugs because when they paid just a tiny fraction of what we do."
  }, {
    "speaker" : "CHRIS WALLACE",
    "statement" : "Okay, like I say, this is open discussion."
  }, {
    "speaker" : "DONALD TRUMP",
    "statement" : "This is big stuff."
  }, {
    "speaker" : "CHRIS WALLACE",
    "statement" : "Sir, you'll be happy. I'm about to pick up on one of your points to ask the Vice President, which is, he points out that you would like to add a public option to Obamacare."
  }, {
    "speaker" : "JOE BIDEN",
    "statement" : "Yes."
  }, {
    "speaker" : "CHRIS WALLACE",
    "statement" : "And the argument that he makes and other Republicans make is that that is going to end private insurance."

  }, {
    "speaker" : "CHRIS WALLACE",

    "statement" : "That's not what your party says, by the way."

    "speaker" : "CHRIS WALLACE",
    "statement" : "And it will end private insurance and create a government takeover of health."
  }, {
    "speaker" : "JOE BIDEN",
    "statement" : "It does not. It's only for those people who are so poor they qualify for Medicaid they can get that free in most States, except Governors who want to deny people who are poor Medicaid. Anyone who qualifies for Medicare, excuse me, Medicaid would automatically be enrolled in the public option. The vast majority of the American people would still not be in that option. Number one. Number two."

    "speaker" : "DONALD TRUMP",
    "statement" : "Joe, you agreed with Bernie Sanders, who's far left, on the manifesto, we call it. And that gives you socialized medicine."

    "statement" : "Are you saying you didn't agree?"

We guaranteed pre-existing conditions, but took away the individual mandate. Listen, this is the way it is. And that destroyed ... They shouldn't even call it Obamacare, then I had a choice to make, do I let my people run it really well or badly? If I run it badly, they'll probably blame him, but they'll blame me. But more importantly, I want to help people. Okay. I said, \"You've got to run it so well.\" And I just had a meeting with them. They said the problem is, no matter how well you run Obamacare, it's a disaster. It's too expensive. Premiums are too high, that it doesn't work. So we do want to get rid of it. Chris, we want to get rid of that and give something that's cheaper and better."

You call this a distraction by the President. But, in fact, it wasn't brought up by the President. It was brought up by some of your Democratic colleagues in the Congress. So my question to you is, you have refused in the past to talk about it, are you willing to tell the American tonight whether or not you will support either ending the filibuster or packing the court?"

Even after we produce a vaccine, experts say that it could be months or even years before we come back to anything approaching normal. My question for both of you is, based on what you have said and done so far, and what you have said you would do starting in 2021, why should the American people trust you more than your opponent to deal with this public health crisis going forward? In this case, the question goes to you first, sir. Two minutes, uninterrupted."

He knew all the way back in February how serious this crisis was. He knew it was a deadly disease. What did he do? He's on tape as acknowledging he knew it.

Young children aren't, even younger people aren't. We've learned a lot, but he wants to shut it down. More people will be hurt by continuing.

Because it's after the election. They think they're hurting us by keeping them closed. They're hurting people. People know what to do. They can social distance.

You call them super predators, and you've called them worse than that. Because you look back at your testimony over the years, you've called them a lot worse than that. As far as the church is concerned and as far as the generals are concerned, we just got the support of 250 military leaders and generals, total support.

If you look at Chicago, if you look at any place you want to look, Seattle, they heard we were coming in the following day and they put up their hands and we got back Seattle.

And when they occur, when they find them, they have to be sorted out. They have to be held accountable. They have to be held accountable.

It makes a gigantic difference in the way a child is able to grow up and have a sense of self-esteem. It's a little bit like how this guy and his friends look down on so many people. They look down their nose on people like Irish Catholics, like me, who grow up in Scranton. They look down on people who don't have money. They look down on people who are of a different faith. They looked down on people who are a different color. In fact, we're all Americans. The only way we're going to bring this country together is bring everybody together.

Many of those turned into riots. Mr. Vice-president you say that people who commit crimes should be held accountable. The question I have though is as the democratic nominee, and earlier tonight, you said that you are the Democratic Party right now, have you ever called the Democratic Mayor of Portland or the Democratic Governor of Oregon and said, \"Hey, you got to stop this, bring in the National Guard, do whatever it takes, but you'd stop the days and months of violence in Portland.\""

A fixing of the VA which was a mess under him, 308,000 people died because they didn't have proper health care. It was a mess. And we now got a 91% approval rating at the VA, our vets. We take care of our vets. But we've rebuilt our military. And I'll tell you something, some people say maybe the most important by the end of the first term I'll have approximately 300 Federal judges and Court of Appeals judges, 300 and hopefully three great Supreme Court judges, justices that is a record the likes of which very few people and one of the reasons I'll have so many judges because President Obama and him left me 128 judges to fill."

He's President United States. It's on his watch. And with regard to more divided the nation, it can't stay divided. We can't be this way. And speaking of my son, the way you talk about the military, the way you talk about them being losers and being and just being suckers. My son was in Iraq. He spent a year there.

And people are actually very happy about what's going on because our businesses are doing well. As far as the fires are concerned, you need forest management. In addition to everything else, the forest floors are loaded up with trees, dead trees that are years old and they're like tinder and leaves and everything else.

California's burning, California's burning. If that was cleaned, if that were, if you had forest management, good forest management, you wouldn't be getting those calls. In Europe, they live they're forest cities. They call forest cities. They maintain their forest. They manage their forest. I was with the head of a major country, it's a forest city. He said, \"Sir, we have trees that are far more, they ignite much easier than California. There shouldn't be that problem.\" I spoke with the Governor about it. I'm getting along very well with the governor.

But a lot of people agree with me, many people. The car has gotten so expensive because they have computers all over the place for an extra little bit of gasoline.

Number one, number two, we're going to make sure that we are able to take the federal fleet and turn it into a fleet that's run on their electric vehicles. Making sure that we can do that, we're going to put 500,000 charging stations in all of the highways that we're going to be building in the future. We're going to build a economy that in fact is going to provide for the ability of us to take 4 million buildings and make sure that they in fact are weatherized in a way that in fact will they'll emit significantly less gas and oil because the heat will not be going out.

Not 15 bucks an hour, but prevailing wage, by having a new infrastructure that in fact, is green. And the first thing I will do, I will rejoin the Paris Accord. I will join the Paris Accord because with us out of it, look what's happening. It's all falling apart. And talk about someone who has no relationship with foreign policy. The rainforests of Brazil are being torn down, are being ripped down. More carbon is absorbed in that rainforest than every bit of carbon that's emitted in the United States. Instead of doing something about that, I would be gathering up and making sure we had the countries of the world coming up with $20 billion, and say, \"Here's $20 billion.

Look what's happened just in the Midwest with these storms that come through and wipe out entire sections and counties in Iowa. They didn't happen before. They're because of global warming.

The fact is that there are going to be millions of people because of COVID that are going to be voting by mail-in ballots like he does, by the way. He sits behind the Resolute Desk and sends his ballot to Florida, number one. Number two, we're going to make sure that those people who want to vote in person are able to vote because there are enough poll watchers are there to make sure they can socially distance. The polls are open on time, and the polls stay open until the votes are counted.

They came after me spying on my campaign. They started from the day I won, and even before I won. From the day I came down the escalator with our first lady, they were a disaster. They were a disgrace to our country, and we've caught them. We've caught them all. We've got it all on tape. We've caught them all. And by the way, you gave the idea for the Logan Act against General Flynn. You better take a look at that, because we caught you in a sense, and President Obama was sitting in the office."

You're soliciting. You're asking. They send it back. You send it back. I did that. If you have an unsolicited... They're sending millions of ballots all over the country. There's fraud. They found them in creeks. They found some, just happened to have the name Trump just the other day in a wastepaper basket. They're being sent all over the place. They sent two in a Democrat area. They sent out a thousand ballots. Everybody got two ballots. This is going to be a fraud like you've never seen. The other thing, it's nice.

An election could be won or lost with that. They're losing 30 and 40%. It's a fraud, and it's a shame.
